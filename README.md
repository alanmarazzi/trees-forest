# Don't get lost in a forest

Reference repo for "Don't get lost in a forest" post on [rdisorder.eu](http://wp.me/p7RraT-63).

## What you'll find

Full code to follow along the post, data stored directly in the `/data` folder and a [project page](https://alanmarazzi.github.io/trees-forest/) explaining how to run the code and giving an intro to `dplyr` and `intubate` packages.

## How to run

You can either clone this repo locally with

```
git clone https://github.com/alanmarazzi/trees-forest.git
```

and then run [titanic.R](https://github.com/alanmarazzi/trees-forest/blob/master/titanic.R), or you can follow along the file in your R session.

If you have any issue reproducing results (you can find accuracy of every algorithm in the titanic.R file) or running the analysis let me know by filing it in this repo.
